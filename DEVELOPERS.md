Note about version history:
- Version `v0.9.0` is basically a snapshot of the code from (with minor path adjustment):
  https://github.com/orionlee/violentmonkey/commit/3535cddd16028bd727a2cc04b44bd31829417f29

- Commits after `v0.9.0` are in this repository only.

- The codes started out as a [pull request for Violentmonkey](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/pull/1022), it was decided to split the generic javascript-mixed support into its own repository, before the pull request was merged.
    - The commits prior to `v0.9.0` are snapshots of major changes, before the codes are migrated here. If one needs to know the details of the changes, see the version history in the pull request.
